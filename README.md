**Here you will find:**
-A JWT system for autenticate users 
-An app called 'sequences' who connects with a NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) API with the purpose of compare a DNA sequence introduced for the users and find sequence_id, sequence_name , sequence_lenght and description about. Is an organized way to access very useful information for Bioinformatics engineers.
-A responsive and simple HTML and CSS design.
